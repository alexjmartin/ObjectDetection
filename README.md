# ObjectDetection

This respository houses the code utilized for my object detection assignment (AC53014) and includes scripts which:
- Scrape open source images from unsplash via API
- Download relevant object detection models
- Train and evaluate an object detection model for F1 Cars
- Populates image predictions from the model for a submitted TF-Record set

It's use is intended as a personal repository for code storage only but if anyone finds it's useful you're welcome to fork the code. I will not accept any contributors to the project as this is an assessed code base so must be all my own work.

I have made use of object detection tutorials freely available online as a basis for many of these scripts and reference those tutorials in the comments of any scripts.
